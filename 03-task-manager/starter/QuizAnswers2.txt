1. In this lesson, you created a middleware function called asyncWrapper. Why?
    Prior to using the asyncWrapper, we had originally used async/wait with each action using a try/catch. However, this became redundant so we used a resuable function/middleware that could be used instead making it shorter/easier to understand. 

2. Suppose that you want to make sure that both a status code and and error message are send back to the user when they request the URL for a task that does not exist. Assume that you’ve created a CustomAPIError class and an error handler that references that class. Complete the code:

const getTask = asyncWrapper(async (req, res, next) => {
  const { id: taskID } = req.params;
  const task = await Task.findOne({ _id: taskID });
  if (!task) {
    return next(createCustomError(`There isn't any task with this id ${taskID}`, 404))
  }
  res.status(200).json({ task });
});
